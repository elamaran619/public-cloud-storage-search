# Public Cloud Storage Search
This is a search engine for content shared publicly via cloud storage services,
built using [Google's Cloud Search Engine (CSE)](https://cse.google.com/cse/).
The tools allows searching across all content that is
indexed by Google and being served from cloud storage services such
as Amazon S3, Azure Blobs, etc.

# Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to aid security researchers who are doing open
source research.

# How it works
This tool uses Google's CSE to restrict searches against content being
served by the URLs known to be used by public cloud storage services.
It is essentially a search engine that is limited to a subet of sites. It is
build via a set of match patterns which are then imported into the CSE console
to build a working search engine. There are also some labels that allow users
to search specific cloud vendors. For more information, see [the official
CSE documentation](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview).
While this tool is build using CSE, it can theoretically be rebuild any other
search engine tool that supports similar functionality.

A list of patterns can be found in [PATTERNS.md](PATTERNS.md) file.
A live version of the search engine is available [here](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=002972716746423218710:veac6ui3rio).

# Wishlist
Some things we plan in the future:
   * Convert patterns to XML files so they can be imported/exported automatically
   * Add support for non-Google search engines
